# A simple atlas of global map projections
A very quickly thrown together Python web app built using Marimo in about as long as it took to visit the [proj.org](https://proj.org) website and visit the included projections!

See the app here: [projection atlas](https://dosull.github.io/projection-atlas/app/)

Made with Natural Earth. Free vector and raster map data @ [naturalearthdata.com](https://naturalearth.com).
